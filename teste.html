			"In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons.<br>
			But then there was fire, and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and dark.<br>
			Then from the dark, they came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame.<br>
			Nito, the first of the dead,<br>
			the Witch of Izalith, and her Daughters of Chaos,<br>
			Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights,<br>
			and the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten.<br><br>

			"With the Strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons.<br>
			Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales.<br>
			The Witches weaved great firestorms.<br>
			Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease.<br>
			And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no more.<br><br>

			"Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon, the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.<br>
			Even now, there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights.<br>
			And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign."<br><br>

			"Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead.<br>
			And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north,<br>
			where they are locked away, to await the end of the world.<br>
			... This is your fate."
